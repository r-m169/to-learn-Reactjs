I have received intensive training from the Information Technology Institute (ITI), where I acquired strong skills in developing user interfaces using the latest technologies. I have successfully completed several small projects, enhancing my proficiency in front-end development techniques and code organization methods. Utilizing libraries like React, I have built creative interactive interfaces that provide smooth and exceptional user experiences. My passion for creating appealing and functional interfaces drives me to continuously expand my knowledge and skills to deliver effective and outstanding solutions for improving user experiences on the web.
